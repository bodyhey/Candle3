Technical information for my use:
---------------------------------

To check .a and .dll versions I used objdump and readelf

SFML-2.6.1 compiled from sources. CMake was needed and the rest
happens in QTCreator. joystickplugin is created and SFML-2.6.1-Released.

QT Creator 14 and Python 2

https://bugreports.qt.io/browse/QTCREATORBUG-31370

MinGW 8.1 comes with a GDB that uses Python 2.7 for scripting. This is not supported anymore.

You have several options:
1. Use a newer MinGW
2. Copy all the *.py files from
https://code.qt.io/cgit/qt-creator/qt-creator.git/tree/share/qtcreator/debugger-with-python2?h=14.0
(python2_debugger_for_qt_14.zip)
into your
C:/Qt/Tools/QtCreator/share/qtcreator/debugger/
3. Use Creator 13.x
